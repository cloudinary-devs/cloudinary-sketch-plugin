<h1 align="center"> Cloudinary plugin for Sketch</h1>

This Sketch plugin aims to help Sketch users to:
* **Fetch** images from Cloudinary DAM into designs.
* **Uploading** Artboards (or layers) *directly* to Cloudinary using an Upload preset.

::: tip WHAT'S SPECIAL
The images fetched will be optimized in size with `g_auto` and `q_auto`.

The plugin was developed as part of the Cloudinary Hackathon (May 2019).
