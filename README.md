<h1 align="center"> Cloudinary plugin for Sketch</h1>
This Sketch plugin allows designers to fetch images from Cloudinary DAM. It also allows Uploading Artboards (or layers) *directly* to Cloudinary using an Upload preset.

The images fetched will be optimized in size with g_auto and q_auto.

The plugin was developed as part of the Cloudinary Hackathon (May 2019).
