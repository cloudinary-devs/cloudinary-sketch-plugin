<h1 align="center"> Cloudinary plugin for Sketch</h1>

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9466625f-03ea-41d4-9500-5b35c64b3274/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cloudinary-sketch-plugin/deploys)

This Sketch plugin allows designers to fetch images from Cloudinary DAM. It also allows Uploading Artboards (or layers) *directly* to Cloudinary using an Upload preset.

The images fetched will be optimized in size with g_auto and q_auto.

The plugin was developed as part of the Cloudinary Hackathon (May 2019).
